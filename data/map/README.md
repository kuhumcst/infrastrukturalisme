## About these files

There are two vega specs, which are possible to read more about [here]().
One of the vega specs is using the data file in here.

### Raw data files
The worldcities.csv is a file containing latitude and longitude for a large portion of the world's biggist cities.
The coordinates.json holds the same information but in json format.

### The python script
<ins>Input</ins>: worldcities.csv  
<ins>Output</ins>: coordinates.json

The coordinationtransform.py is a script for making a json file out of the input csv file.
